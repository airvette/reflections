Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: A remote repositor would be used when you are working as a group on a project.  It provides one central location where all
members of the team can make changes and updates to the project.  The this approach is especially useful when the members of the
team are geographically separated.


Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Pulling changes manually provides the user great control over the version
of their work.  If Git automatically pushed changes to one's local computer, one
might have their work overwritten or disassociated with the master/current
branch causing confusion with the individual or the team.  Doing manual pulls
allows the user to make commits when they are ready.
