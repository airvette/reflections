Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: A remote repositor would be used when you are working as a group on a project.  It provides one central location where all 
members of the team can make changes and updates to the project.  The this approach is especially useful when the members of the
team are geographically separated.
